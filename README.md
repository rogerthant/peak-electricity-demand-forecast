# **Household-Level Day-Ahead Peak Electricity Demand Forecast**

This repository contains materials from my MSc Data Science dissertation, which was awarded a **Distinction** at the University of Manchester. The project focuses on developing machine learning models to forecast household-level day-ahead peak electricity demand using the Low Carbon London dataset and detailed London weather data.

## **Key Components**
### **Dissertation**
- The full dissertation is provided as `dissertation.pdf`, detailing the methodology, results, and implications of the study.

### **Notebook**
- `Model-Development-Cbrt-No-Scaler.ipynb`: Optimized model with cube root transformation of the target variable. <br>

  Note: Only the notebook related to the final model development is included to comply with data safeguarding policies.

### **Supplementary Materials**
- Figures used in the dissertation are included in the `supplementary/key-figures` folder.

## **Data Sources**
- Weather datasets used in this study are included in the `weather-data` folder. These were retrieved using [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services) and merged by me.
- The Low Carbon London dataset is not provided in this repository due to licensing restrictions. However, it can be accessed via the UK Data Service:  [Low Carbon London Dataset](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=7857).

## **Acknowledgements**
I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Fanlin Meng, for his invaluable guidance and encouragement throughout this project. Special thanks to my family, friends, and colleagues for their support.
